			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Water is absolutely vital to life on Planet Earth. Especially in America, water is something that we largely take for granted. So we at Jellyfish, have dedicated our 2019 efforts toward clean water. We are doing quarterly beach clean-ups all up and down the East-Coast to focus on our oceans needs.</p>
			<p>Jellyfish is dedicated to promoting, protecting, and preserving marine life through science-based research endeavors and empowering the general public with ocean conservation facts through engaging public awareness campaigns. Our mission is to formulate practical conservation solutions that benefit both humanity and wildlife through an innovative blend of education and science. </p>

			<h2>Sea Jellies</h2>
			<p>Jellyfish live mainly in the ocean, but they aren't actually fish -- they're plankton. These plants and animals either float in the water or possess such limited swimming powers that currents control their horizontal movements. Some plankton are microscopic, single-celled organisms, while others are several feet long.</p>
			<p>Jellyfish can range in size from less than an inch to nearly 7 feet long, with tentacles up to 100 feet long. Jellyfish are about 98 percent water. If a jellyfish washes up on the beach, it will mostly disappear as the water evaporates. Most are transparent and bell-shaped. We are dedicated to keeping the ocean clean for jellyfish and all of our ocean friends!</p>
