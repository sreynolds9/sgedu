			<h1>Jellyfish FAQ's</h1>
			<p>Jellyfish are probably some of the most unusual and mysterious creatures that you'll ever encounter. You'll discover that jellyfish are pretty fascinating. They are able to produce toxic venom, emit light and may even hold the secrets to immortality!</p>
			<p>Jellyfish are carnivores -- they eat other animals. Smaller jellyfish eat algae and other tiny plankton called zooplankton. Larger jellyfish eat crustaceans and other bigger aquatic animals. They don't seek out people to attack -- their nervous system is too simple to do that. Their sting is both a defense mechanism and a way to capture their prey. Check out our range of fun jellyfish facts for kids below!</p>
