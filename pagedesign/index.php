			<h1>We love Jellyfish!</h1>
			<p>Jellyfish are probably some of the most unusual and mysterious creatures that you'll ever encounter. With their gelatinous bodies and dangling tentacles, they look more like something from a horror movie than a real animal. But if you can get past the weirdness -- and the fact that getting too close to one results in a nasty sting -- you'll discover that jellyfish are pretty fascinating. They've been around for more than 650 million years, and there are thousands of different species, with more species discovered all of the time.</p>

			<h2>Jellies</h2>
			<p>Jellyfish and sea jellies are the informal common names given to the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, a major part of the phylum Cnidaria. Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing tentacles, although a few are not mobile, being anchored to the seabed by stalks. The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion and highly efficient locomotion. The tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey and defend against predators. Jellyfish have a complex life cycle; the medusa is normally the sexual phase, the planula larva can disperse widely and is followed by a sedentary polyp phase.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Jellyfish are prehistoric creatures that have inhabited oceans around the world for millions of years. Although their gelatinous bodies and graceful movements make them appear to be complex creatures, they are actually quite simple in both form and function. Jellyfish are planktons that have no bones, brain, or heart. In fact, their bodies are mostly water and have just six major parts. Although they are not aggressive creatures by nature, jellyfish are often remembered for their nasty stinging capabilities. Jellyfish mostly use their tentacles for hunting, but will also sting in self-defense. When jellyfish sting humans, it is always done in self-defense since humans are far too large for any jellyfish to eat.</p>
